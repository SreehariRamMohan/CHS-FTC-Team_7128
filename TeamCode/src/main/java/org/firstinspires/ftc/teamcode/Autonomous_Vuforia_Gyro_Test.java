         * In order for localization to work, we need to tell the system where each target we
         * wish to use for navigation resides on the field, and we need to specify where on the robot
         * the phone resides. These specifications are in the form of <em>transformation matrices.</em>
         * Transformation matrices are a central, important concept in the math here involved in localization.
         * See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix">Transformation Matrix</a>
         * for detailed information. Commonly, you'll encounter transformation matrices as instances
         * of the {@link OpenGLMatrix} class.
         *
         * For the most part, you don't need to understand the details of the math of how transformation
         * matrices work inside (as fascinating as that is, truly). Just remember these key points:
         * <ol>
         *
         *     <li>You can put two transformations together to produce a third that combines the effect of
         *     both of them. If, for example, you have a rotation transform R and a translation transform T,
         *     then the combined transformation matrix RT which does the rotation first and then the translation
         *     is given by {@code RT = T.multiplied(R)}. That is, the transforms are multiplied in the
         *     <em>reverse</em> of the chronological order in which they applied.</li>
         *
         *     <li>A common way to create useful transforms is to use methods in the {@link OpenGLMatrix}
         *     class and the Orientation class. See, for example, {@link OpenGLMatrix#translation(float,
         *     float, float)}, {@link OpenGLMatrix#rotation(AngleUnit, float, float, float, float)}, and
         *     {@link Orientation#getRotationMatrix(AxesReference, AxesOrder, AngleUnit, float, float, float)}.
         *     Related methods in {@link OpenGLMatrix}, such as {@link OpenGLMatrix#rotated(AngleUnit,
         *     float, float, float, float)}, are syntactic shorthands for creating a new transform and
         *     then immediately multiplying the receiver by it, which can be convenient at times.</li>
         *
         *     <li>If you want to break open the black box of a transformation matrix to understand
         *     what it's doing inside, use {@link MatrixF#getTranslation()} to fetch how much the
         *     transform will move you in x, y, and z, and use {@link Orientation#getOrientation(MatrixF,
         *     AxesReference, AxesOrder, AngleUnit)} to determine the rotational motion that the transform
         *     will impart. See {@link #format(OpenGLMatrix)} below for an example.</li>
         *
         * </ol>

         * This example places the "stones" image on the perimeter wall to the Left
         *  of the Red Driver station wall.  Similar to the Red Beacon Location on the Res-Q
         *
         * This example places the "chips" image on the perimeter wall to the Right
         *  of the Blue Driver station.  Similar to the Blue Beacon Location on the Res-Q
         *

         *
         * Initially the target is conceptually lying at the origin of the field's coordinate system
         * (the center of the field), facing up.
         *
         * In this configuration, the target's coordinate system aligns with that of the field.
         *
         * In a real situation we'd also account for the vertical (Z) offset of the target,
         * but for simplicity, we ignore that here; for a real robot, you'll want to fix that.
         *

         * - Then we rotate it  90 around the field's Z access to face it away from the audience.
